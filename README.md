## Features

1. Two simple calendars with paper submission deadlines and conference dates
2. Simple subscription to calendar in Outlook, iOS Calendar, Thunderbird, ...
3. Automatic updates


## Description

This repository provides a simple website that lists the conference dates and
deadlines for calls for papers for various IEEE conferences in the areas of
communications, information theory, and signal processing.
It is automatically updated every Sunday. However, the conference dates are
entered manually at the moment.

Another feature is the automatic export of two iCalendars, which you can
subscribe to in your calendar/mail app, such as Outlook, iOS Calendars,
Thunderbird.

Note that this version only features conferences organized by certain IEEE
societies. However, you can fork this project and adapt it to show the
deadlines and dates of the conferences you are interested in. Details can be
found below in the [Customization](#customization) section.



## Usage
If you only want to use the website, simply navigate to
[https://klb2.github.io/conference-calendar/](https://klb2.github.io/conference-calendar/).

### Subscribe to the Calendar
The website automatically exports iCalendar files that you can subscribe to.
The URLs are:
- Conference dates: https://klb2.github.io/conference-calendar/conferences.ics
- Submission deadlines: https://klb2.github.io/conference-calendar/deadlines.ics

If you want to automatically get updates, you can add them as a subscription to
your calendar/mail app. As an example, you can you can find the steps for iOS
and Thunderbird below. However, the exact workflow depends on the program you
are using.

  2. Leave the "Username" field empty. In "Location", enter the URL of the
     calendar from above, e.g.,
     `https://klb2.github.io/conference-calendar/conferences.ics` for the
     calendar containing the conference dates. Check "This location doesn't
     require credentials".
  3. Make sure the calendar is selected and hit "Subscribe".


#### iOS
The following steps are for adding the calendar subscription to the iOS
Calendar app (tested with iOS 18.1). Details can also be found at

## Customization
If you want to build your own custom conference calendar website, you can
follow the steps below.

1. Fork/copy/download this repository.
2. Delete all existing files in the `data/` directory (assuming you do not want
   to keep them.)
3. Create a new `.yml` file in the `data/` directory that contains the
   conferences you want to show in your calendar. As a guideline, you can use
   the existing yaml files in this repository. Details about the individual
   fields/attributes of a conference entry can be found in
   [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-more-ieee-conferences-or-fixing-dates).
4. To compile/test everything locally, follow the steps in the
   [Development](#development) section below. If you are using Github, the
   website should be built automatically once a week and on new pushes.


## Development
If you want to build the website yourself, you need to have Python3 installed
on your machine.

To install all required packages simply run
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The website is generated by running
```bash
python3 generate_website.py
```

The final website can then be found as `public/index.html`.
