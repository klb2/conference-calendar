# IEEE Conference Calendar

**Website: https://klb2.github.io/conference-calendar/**

This repository provides a simple website that lists the conference dates and
deadlines for calls for papers for various IEEE conferences in the areas of
communications, information theory, and signal processing.
It is automatically updated every Sunday. However, the conference dates are
entered manually at the moment.

Note that this list is not complete and only features certain IEEE societies.
Please report any issues/bugs that you find as a GitHub issue.

If you would like to add more content/dates or fix bugs, please open up a pull
request.
Contributing guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Usage/Development
If you want to build the website on your own, you need to have Python3
installed on your machine.

To install all required packages simply run
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The website is generated by running
```bash
python3 generate_website.py
```

The final website can then be found as `public/index.html`.
