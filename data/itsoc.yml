    The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, or ISIT, is the
    flagship conference of the IEEE Information Theory Society. The symposium
    centers around the presentation of previously unpublished contributions in
    all of the areas of information theory, including source and channel
    coding, communication theory and systems, cryptography and security,
    detection and estimation, networks, pattern recognition and learning,
    statistics, stochastic processes and complexity, and signal processing.
    Furthermore, it provides an open forum to discuss and exchange with other
    researchers on any of these topics.
